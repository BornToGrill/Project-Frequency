# Project Frequency

A strategy game based of the board game Frequency.

# Background

The game was made for a school project. 3 Months prior we had to make a physical board game, 
we had to choose one of three games selected and make a digital version.
Of the three games Frequency was by far the most interesting so we decided we would make it.
